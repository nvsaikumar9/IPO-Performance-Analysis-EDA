# IPO Performance Analysis & Risk Profiling
## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of 380+ Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). The goal is to move beyond market hype and identify the actual quantitative drivers—and risks—of listing day performance.
## 🚀 Key Insights & Findings
Through this analysis, I identified several contrarian trends that challenge traditional investment assumptions:
•	The Valuation Ceiling: High-ticket IPOs (Price Bands ~₹2000) and wide price spreads (>₹80) often signal overvaluation, correlating with negative listing gains.
•	The Scale Paradox: "Mega-IPOs" (Issue Size >₹15,000 CR or Market Cap >₹1 Lakh CR) frequently face listing pressure compared to mid-sized issues.
•	Demand Benchmarks: Established clear "Success Floors" for investor participation:
o	QIB: >80x subscription for high-confidence positive gains.
o	NII: >100x subscription for positive/neutral momentum.
o	RII: >50x subscription as a robust retail safety indicator.
